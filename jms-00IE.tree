\p{We now come to an example of a [relation between multiple sets](jms-00I7): we could define a relation #{R\subseteq \text{Movies}\times\text{Directors}\times\text{Years}\times\text{People}} consisting of tuples \prn{m,d,y,p} where #{m} is a movie directed by #{d} in year #{y} with #{p} as a cast member.}
