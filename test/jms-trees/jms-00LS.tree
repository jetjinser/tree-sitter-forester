\p{[[jms-00HY]] makes some breaking changes to the XML format; if you are using the [default theme](https://git.sr.ht/~jonsterling/forester-base-theme), just update it to the latest version to migrate your forest. The main change is that “trails” for subtrees (like “1.4.2”) are no longer computed ahead of time and stored in XML, but are instead computed on the fly in the XSLT stylesheet using \code{<xsl:number>}.}

\p{A further change is that embedded #{\LaTeX} is no longer emitted using the \code{<img>} element: instead, there is a new \code{<embedded-tex>} element with an attribute \code{@hash} containing the name (without extension) of the appropriate SVG file, and with children elements \code{<embedded-tex-preamble>} and \code{<embedded-tex-body>}. These are meant to facilitate generation of #{\LaTeX} documents from [[jms-005P]]’s XML output in combination with the \code{filecontents} environment.}
