\p{The other composite #{\matrix-of-rel_S\circ \rel-of-matrix_S\colon \MAT{S}{m}{n}\to\MAT{S}{m}{n}} is not in general the identity function, but is (necessarily) an \em{idempotent} on the set of matrices over #{S}. We will see that this idempotent, in some sense, measures the degree to which the base semiring #{S} is not boolean.}

\p{Thus we conclude that an \nowrap{\prn{m\times n}-matrix} over the booleans is the same thing as a relation from \brk{m} to \brk{n}.}
