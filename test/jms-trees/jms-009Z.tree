\p{This page accumulates project ideas that could be taken on by Part III/MPhil students at [[ucam]], or very advanced Part II students in some cases.}

\p{Please note that an MPhil/Part III project report is different from a Part II dissertation, and so not all projects here will be suitable for all students. Please contact me at [js2878@cl.cam.ac.uk](mailto:js2878@cl.cam.ac.uk) if you are interested in one of these projects, and we can discuss what would be suitable for you.}

\p{\em{(I am still compiling a list of potential projects that I might find interesting. Please contact me \strong{if} you have a semi-specific idea of what you would like to pursue.)}}

\p{Note that projects in my area require a lot of prior expertise, some of which you could not have obtained \em{just} by having taken Parts I–II of the Computer Science Tripos. You are not going to learn category theory for the first time at the same time as doing an MPhil project in category theory—the same holds for type theory or programming language semantics.}
