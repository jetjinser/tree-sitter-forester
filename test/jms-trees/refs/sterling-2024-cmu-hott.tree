\p{In 1997, [Hofmann and Streicher](hofmann-streicher-1997) introduced an explicit technique to lift a Grothendieck universe \U from \SET into the category of \SET\relax{-}valued presheaves on a \U\relax{-}small category \B. More recently, [Awodey](awodey-2022-universes) presented an elegant functorial analysis of this construction in terms of the \em{‘categorical nerve’}, the right adjoint to the functor that takes a presheaf to its category of elements; in particular, applying the categorical nerve to the universal \U\relax{-}small discrete fibration gives the generic family of \U\relax{’s} Hofmann–Streicher lifting.}

\p{Although [Awodey](awodey-2022-universes) has investigated Hofmann–Streicher lifting in terms of a 1-functor \mrow{\CAT\to \Pr{\B}}, his analysis can be extended to a 2-functor \mrow{\CAT\to\Fib{\B}} that is observed by [Weber](weber-2007) to be right 2-adjoint to the 2-functor that takes a fibred category to its total category (i.e. the oplax colimit of the corresponding diagram of categories under straightening). A generalised form of Hofmann–Streicher lifting that can be applied to categories other than universes is then obtained by conjugating this right 2-adjoint with duality involutions.}

\p{In joint work with [[danielgratzer]] and [[andrewslattery]], we have constructed a \em{relative} version of the 2-functorial Hofmann–Streicher lifting: given a fibration \mrow{\mi{p}\lcolon \A\to \B}, we have a 2-functor \mrow{\<mml:msub>{\mi{Δ}\mi{p}} \lcolon \Fib{\B}\to\Fib{\A}} which is \em{not} base change but rather (we conjecture) right \em{pseudo}-adjoint to the 2-functor \mrow{\<mml:msub>{\mi{Σ}\mi{p}} \lcolon \Fib{\B}\to\Fib{\A}} that sends a fibration \mrow{\mi{q}\lcolon \E\to\A} to the composite fibration \mrow{\mrow{\mi{p}\mo{∘}\mi{q}}\mcolon \E\to\B}. A relative version of Hofmann–Streicher lifting could give a more regular theory to the practice of computing \em{internal} liftings of lifted universes.}
