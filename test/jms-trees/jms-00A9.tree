\p{A \em{dcpo presentation} consists of a preorder #{P} of generators together with a subset #{C\subseteq P\times\Omega\Sup{\vrt{P}}} such that for every #{\prn{a\lhd U}\in C}, the subset #{U} is directed in #{P}. Absent the condition that every distinguished subset be directed, we refer to #{C} as a \em{cover set} on #{P}.}
