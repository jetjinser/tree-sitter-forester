\p{Although we are speaking of “being isomorphic” as the property of there being a [bijection](jms-00KR) between them, in practice, it is almost \em{never} useful to know that there exists some undetermined [bijection](jms-00KR) between given sets; it is always important to know \em{which} [bijection](jms-00KR). Indeed, we have seen in \ref{jms-00KT} that there can be many distinct [bijections](jms-00KR) between two sets.}
