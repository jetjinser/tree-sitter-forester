\p{[Voevodsky](vladimirvoevodsky)’s [\em{univalent foundations} and \em{homotopy type theory}](hottbook) comprise a new and radical approach to the foundations of mathematics in which the structural properties of \em{equality} are extended to every possible form of equivalence and symmetry, leading to an expanded universe of discourse in which ordinary sets and algebraic structures exist harmoniously alongside infinite-dimensional spaces. In this talk, I will expose the basic grammar and vocabulary of the new univalent foundations — and explain how they shed light on basic problems in theoretical computer science and the specification of computer programs.}
