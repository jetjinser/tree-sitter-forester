\let\C{#{\mathcal{C}}}

\p{Let \Mor{p}{E}{U} be a morphism in #{\Psh\C}, and let #{\Gamma} be a representable object. We shall use the following notations inspired by dependent type theory to refer to elements of #{U} and #{E}:}

\ol{
  \li{We shall write \prn{\Gamma\vdash_p A} to refer to a morphism \Mor{A}{\Gamma}{U}.}
  \li{Given \prn{\Gamma\vdash_p A}, we shall write \prn{\Gamma\vdash_p a : A} to refer to a morphism \Mor{a}{\Gamma}{E} such that the composite #{\Gamma\xrightarrow{a}E\xrightarrow{p}U} is equal to \Mor{A}{\Gamma}{U}.}
