\p{We are now ready to describe \em{natural models}. The purpose of the [preceding lemmas](jms-00E2) was to provide a [fully algebraic and diagrammatic](jms-00E4) description of natural models as an alternative to the usual [presheaf-theoretic description](jms-00E3). The difference between these descriptions begins to matter when organizing natural models into a (2,1)-category â€” what seems arbitrary in the language of presheaves becomes completely natural in the diagrammatic language, so much so that someone who has seen the diagrammatic definition of natural models would not find it difficult to reconstruct from scratch the [appropriate notion of morphism](jms-00E5).}
