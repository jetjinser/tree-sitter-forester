\p{Now that you have [installed](jms-006W) the \Forester software, it is time to set up your \forest. \Forester provides a simple command to initialise a fresh \forest within a folder. Weâ€™ll call our folder \code{forest}, but you can call it anything you want.}

\pre\verb<<<|
mkdir forest
cd forest
<<<

\p{Now that we are inside our new directory, we can instruct \Forester to initialise a \forest.}

\pre{forester init}

\p{This command initialises a \git repository with the skeleton of a \forest, which contains a configuration file named \code{forest.toml}; this file specifies the locations of your trees, assets, etc. There is also a \git submodule bound to the \code{theme/} directory (pointing to the [base theme](https://git.sr.ht/~jonsterling/forester-base-theme) repository) that contains the stylesheets that web browsers will need in order to render your \forest as HTML.}
