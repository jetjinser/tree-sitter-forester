\p{It depends a lot on what subfield you are specialising in; some subfields, including artificial intelligence, have enthusiastically participated in the publications arms race at all levels \em{including} PhD admissions. If your application reaches my desk, I don’t care about your publications; I care about your potential. A strong publication record at this age mainly tells me that you were very lucky and did your undergraduate at a top research university; this informs me very little as to your suitability for a PhD. There is also a difference between publishing original research and working as a technician on someone else’s paper; both are respectable, but the former is very uncommon for PhD applicants.}

\p{If you have some publications, you should be proud of them. But don’t worry if you haven’t done much of that yet; I find a strong bachelor or masters thesis going deep into some nice mathematics much more compelling than a POPL paper.}
