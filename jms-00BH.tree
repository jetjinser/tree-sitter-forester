\p{Although it is the case that a section in a 1-category is always a monomorphism, it is not the case that every section in an (âˆž,1)-category is an embedding. This can be seen in [homotopy type theory](hottbook), by considering the splitting #{\mathbf{1}\xrightarrow{\lambda\_.\Con{base}}S^1\xrightarrow{!}\mathbf{1}}. If #{\lambda\_.\Con{base}} were an embedding, it would mean that its fibers were propositions: but the fiber of #{\lambda\_.\Con{base}} over #{\Con{base}} is the loop space of #{S^1}, which is a proper set (the integers).}
