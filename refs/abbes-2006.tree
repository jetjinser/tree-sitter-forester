\p{We introduce a new class of morphisms for [event structures](jms-00BN). The category obtained is cartesian closed, and a natural notion of quotient event structure is defined within it. We study in particular the topological space of maximal configurations of quotient event structures. We introduce the compression of event structures as an example of quotient: the compression of an event structure #{E} is a minimal event structure with the same space of maximal configurations as #{E}.}
