\p{I am a proponent of using plain text (or Markdown-formatted) emails rather than HTML-formatted emails. Although there are some legitimate uses for rich formatting in email, I find the well is poisoned: [[jms-00QC]].}

 \title{a renaissance for plain text email?}
 \p{Although plain text email has gone the way of the dinosaur in most parts of society, it remains used among many technical communities (such as the Linux kernel developers, etc.). Recently, [SourceHut](https://sr.ht/) has emerged as a free and open source code forge whose workflow is entirely based on plain text email as described on the [useplaintext.email](https://useplaintext.email) website. Naturally, this has led to both curiosity and friction as users attempt to adapt to working technology of the 1990s that Capital has made increasingly difficult to interact with using present-day software. As a maintainer of several projects on [SourceHut](https://sr.ht/), I have seen many of my valued collaborators completely fall on the ground when it comes to following the [etiquette recommendations for plaintext emails](https://useplaintext.email/#etiquette) (especially text wrapping) and this is certainly not for lack of trying on their part. The available technological options are just that difficult to use.}

 \p{The main viable tools for working with plain text email are terminal-based: for example, [aerc](https://aerc-mail.org/) and [mutt](http://mutt.org/) and its derivatives. These are, however, a non-starter for most users (even technical users): for example, they are difficult to configure, and integrating with address books from standard email providers is nearly impossible or requires a Nobel prize; a bigger problem is that for most of these tools, one must store passwords in plain text (or use some very complicated authentication scheme that a typical user will be unable to set up).}

\p{The only viable modern GUI client recommended by [useplaintext.email](https://useplaintext.email/) for macOS is [[jms-00QE]]. Unfortunately, [[jms-00QE]]â€™s visible settings do not have any option for wrapping text, which would contradict its viability for plaintext email users. Furthermore, the versions of [[jms-00QE]] available for download from its website (both the released version and the prerelease) seem to be incompatible with macOS Sonoma. By doing a bit of spelunking, I have found that both these problems can be solved (at least for now).}
