\p{Even if the ability to format email in rich text via HTML may have first arisen from the legitimate desire of individual to communicate more expressively, HTML-formatted email today primarily functions as a facilitator of hostile \em{marketing} and \em{surveillance} and as a means of control over how humans use computers:}

\ol{
 \li{Flashy visual design is used to draw attention to marketing and sales pitches. This is hostile because it uses psychology to manipulate recipients’ attention to focus on what it would naturally ignore.}
 \li{Images with remote sources are used to surveil recipients: when the client requests the image from the server, this is tracked and used to determine if the recipient has “interacted” with the message. This is hostile because it invades the private life of the recipient.}
 \li{The ubiquity of HTML formatting in non-hostile email (e.g. communications that have legitimate interest such as bank statements, etc.) make it increasingly impractical for recipients to use simple tools of their own choice or even devising to interact with their email. This is hostile because it effectively controls the recipient’s computing choices.}
