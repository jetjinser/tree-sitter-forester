\let\E-cat{#{\mathcal{E}}}

\p{Let \Mor{l}{U}{V} and \Mor{r}{A}{B} be two morphisms in a category \E-cat with pullbacks, such that #{U,V} are exponentiable. Working in the codomain bifibration of \E-cat, we consider the vertical factor of the square \Mor{p^f}{p^V}{p^U} as depicted below:}

\texfig{
  \DiagramSquare{
    height = 1.5cm,
    nw = A^V,
    sw = B^V,
    west = p^V,
    ne = A^U,
    se = B^U,
    east = p^U,
    south = B^f,
    north = A^f,
  }
  \qquad
  \begin{tikzpicture}[diagram,baseline=(sq/sw.base)]
    \SpliceDiagramSquare<sq/>{
      ne = p^U,
      se = B^U,
      sw = A^U,
      nw = \prn{f^U}^*p^U,
      south = f^U,
      north = h_{p^f},
      nw/style = pullback,
      west/style = lies over,
      east/style = lies over,
      north/node/style = upright desc,
      width = 2.5cm,
      height = 1.5cm,
    }
    \node[above = of sq/nw] (nw) {$p^V$};
    \draw[->] (nw) to node[sloped,above] {$p^f$} (sq/ne);
    \draw[->,exists] (nw) to node[upright desc] {$v_{p^f}$} (sq/nw);
  \end{tikzpicture}
}

\p{A \em{(weak, strong) left lifting structure} for \Mor{l}{U}{V} against \Mor{r}{A}{B} is then defined to be a (section, inverse) to the vertical factor \Mor{v_{p^f}}{p^V}{\prn{f^U}^*p^U} in \Sl{\E-cat}{A^U} depicted above â€” or equivalently a (section, inverse) to the underlying morphism in \E-cat of the vertical factor.}
