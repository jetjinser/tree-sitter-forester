\blockquote{
 Juan Block is College Assistant Professor at [[jms-00GP]], and previously was a Janeway Fellow in Economics at the Faculty of Economics. He specialises in microeconomic theory, with a particular interest in game theory. He studies the fundamental economic incentives driving cooperation and reputation in environments where individuals only observe imperfect information about othersâ€™s behaviour. He also investigates the role of learning processes based on social comparisons used by economic agents to make optimal choices when they have limited information and bounded memory.
